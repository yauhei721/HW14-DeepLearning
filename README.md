## CLOSING PRICE

### Which model has a lower loss?

The simple closing price model has lower loss.

### Which model tracks the actual values better over time?

The simple closing price model tracks actual values better.

### Which window size works best for the model?

For simple closing price model, the loss for window size = 10 is 0.0012 and for window size = 5 is 0.002 (based on epoch = 30). So window size = 10 works best.
For the FNG model, the the loss for window size = 10 is 0.0031 and for window size = 5 is 0.038 (based on epoch = 100). So window size = 10 works best.
